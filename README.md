##This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a fully automated ETL (Extract–Transform–Load) data pipeline using Python. The primary objective of this pipeline is to take raw structured data, preprocess and transform it using industry-standard techniques, and generate a clean, machine-learning-ready dataset. The project follows best practices commonly used in data engineering and data science workflows, making it suitable for internship submissions, academic evaluations, and beginner-to-intermediate portfolio building.The pipeline is designed to be robust, reproducible, and environment-independent. It automatically handles missing directories and input files, ensuring that the code executes smoothly when cloned and run on any system, including local machines, cloud platforms, and Google Colab.
